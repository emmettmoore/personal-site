  <div class="about-me">
    <div class="medium-space-left text-portion">
      <h5 class="bold">Hello! My name is Emmett, and I live in Somerville, MA.</h5>
      <p>
        I spent my childhood in Houston, TX, but moved to the greater Boston area just in time for my angsty teenage years.
      </p>
      <p>
      I graduated from <a href="https://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a> in 2015 with a BS in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. Growing up, both my parents were programmers. It was only natural that I would try to avoid my fate for a semester or two, but I eventually came to follow in their footsteps. After taking one class, I was hooked. <strong>There are a lot of great things about computer science, but the thing I love the most is the opportunity to use technical skills to solve tangible problems that are important to me.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While in school, I discovered the best sport in the world. I am obviously talking about rock climbing. <strong>Climbing requires persistence and creativity, and I found that as I grew to become a better climber, I also learned how to think for myself.</strong> I have tried to apply that skill to all facets of my life with varying degrees of success. Over the years I have happily let climbing drag me to some of the most beautiful places in the world and introduce me to many of my best friends along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since graduation, I have applied my interesting in programming to my job as a full stack software engineer at <a href="https://www.insightsquared.com" target="_blank">InsightSquared</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not working or climbing, I am usually:
        <ul>
          <li>Riding my 1980-something Univega around the city until the next thing eventually breaks and I stubbornly try to fix it myself.</li>
          <li>Working on this site, or various other projects.</li>
          <li>Listening to new music (I used to play, now I just listen, but maybe someday I'll get back into playing again).</li>
          <li>Outside.</li>
          <li>Playing with my (parents') dogs.</li>
          <li>Reading.</li>
          <li>Watching the Red Sox.</li>
        </ul>
